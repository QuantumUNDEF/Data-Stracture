Node :- each element normally represented by a Circle.
Edge: - the line connecting two node is called edge.
Father Node/ Parent Node :- It is a immediate predecessor of a node (come b4).
Grand Parents :- It is a parent of a parent.
Child Node : - All the immediate successor of a node is called child node.
Grand Child :- It is a child of a child node.
Root Node:- it is special node which does not have any parents
Siblings :- Two or more node

/*
a datastructure is linear when all the element in a linear order.
NON LINEAR
-> a data structure is non linear when all the elements are not arranged in a linear 
(sequential) order. There is no linear arrangement of the elements. 
Q Why need to non-linear datastructure?
The fundamental disadvantage of a linear ds is that the elements are arranged linearly 
, which slow down the ability to search an element.

#### Searching in a linear ds is sequentially very slow as compare to the non linear ds.
consider a linked list one lakh elements


Tree
->tree is a finite number of nodes in which there is a distinguished node called root of tree.
and the remaining nodes are partitioned into disjoined set.T1,T2,T3...Tn, where n is greater or
equal to zero and each set is itself is a tree.
Or
tree is a non linear ds which can be empty with no nodes or it consist of one special node
called root node with zero or one or more sub trees

Root node

Each element of a tree is called the node of the tree. it is normally represented by a circle in a tree

Edge-> the line connecting to nodes is called edge.

Parent nodes(father nodes)-> It is an immediate predecessor(which come before) of an node.
Grand Parent -> it is a  parent of a parent.
child node -> all the immediate succesor of a node is called child node.
Grand child-> it is of a child of a child node.
root node -> root node is special node which does not have any parents 
remaining node atleast have one parent.
Leaf node-> it is also known as terminal node, is a node which has no child .
Sibling node-> two or more nodes which have same parents.

LEVEL
-> level of any node is define as the distance of that from the root of the tree.

Height of the node-> longest path from node to leaf.

depth of node -> it is the no. of edge from the root to that node.
degree -> the no. of subtrees or children of a node is called degree . 
path is a sequence of node and edge between two node. 
Path length-> it is define as a total no. of edge in a path.
